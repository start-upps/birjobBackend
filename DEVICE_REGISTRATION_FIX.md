# Device Registration Fix Applied
**Date**: June 30, 2025  
**Issue**: `'is_active' is an invalid keyword argument for User`

## 🚨 Problem Identified

**Error Message**: 
```
Error registering device: 'is_active' is an invalid keyword argument for User
```

**Root Cause**: 
The device registration code was trying to pass `is_active=True` to the `User` model constructor, but the `User` model (defined in `/app/models/user.py`) doesn't have an `is_active` column defined.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

**File Changed**: `/app/api/v1/endpoints/devices.py`

**Before** (Causing Error):
```python
if not user:
    # Create a basic user profile for device registration
    user = User(
        device_id=device_id_value,
        is_active=True  # ❌ This field doesn't exist in User model
    )
```

**After** (Fixed):
```python
if not user:
    # Create a basic user profile for device registration
    user = User(
        device_id=device_id_value  # ✅ Only pass valid fields
    )
```

## 📊 Model Definition Analysis

Looking at `/app/models/user.py`, the `User` model has these fields:
- `id`, `device_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, etc.
- **No `is_active` field defined**

The database schema has `is_active` with a default value of `TRUE`, so when we create a user without specifying it, it will automatically get the default value.

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Status**: ✅ Fix Applied to Codebase  
**Deployment**: 🔄 Waiting for Render auto-deployment  
**Expected Result**: Device registration will work without the `is_active` error

## 🧪 Testing

Once deployed, device registration should work with this test:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-API-Key: birjob-ios-api-key-2024" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "device_token": "64_character_hex_string...",
    "device_info": {
      "os_version": "17.0",
      "app_version": "1.0",
      "device_model": "iPhone15,1",
      "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
    }
  }' \
  https://birjobbackend-ir3e.onrender.com/api/v1/devices/register
```

**Expected Success Response**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "device_id": "uuid-device-id",
    "user_id": "uuid-user-id", 
    "registered_at": "2025-06-30T14:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## 📈 Impact

Once this deploys:
- ✅ Device registration errors will be eliminated
- ✅ iOS app users can register devices successfully
- ✅ Push notifications will be functional
- ✅ Job matching will work for registered devices

The fix maintains all existing functionality while resolving the model field mismatch issue.
